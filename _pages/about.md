# Welcome!
Hello there! I'm Alessia, I am currently enrolled in the *Cognitive, Computational, and Social Neurosciences (CCSN)* track as a PhD student at the IMT School. In July 2023, I finally became a licensed psychologist. Other than this I'm intrigued by the interplay of psychology and AI, which has led me to dip my toes into programming, especially in Python. In my downtime, I find joy and adventure in the realms of video games and comics. I'm enthusiastic about sharing and exploring the fascinating interplay between technology and mind.
