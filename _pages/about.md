Hello there! I'm Alessia, I am currently enrolled in the *Cognitive, Computational, and Social Neurosciences (CCSN)* track as a PhD student at the IMT School. In July 2023, I finally became a licensed psychologist. Other than this I'm passionate about both psychology and AI, which has led me to explore the interplay between the two and motivated me to get out of my comfort zone starting to learn programming languages, especially Python. In my downtime, I find joy and adventure in the realms of video games and comics.
